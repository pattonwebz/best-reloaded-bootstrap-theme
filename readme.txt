A Bootstrap 4 powered theme with a vibrant color scheme. It has an emphasis on clear typography with enough space for your content to breath.

== Description ==
Best Reloaded is a theme built using Bootstrap 4 as a base. All the Bootstrap Styles and Scripts are ready to use in your posts or for any custom features. It includes a bundled custom homepage template - with a slider, posts list and 2 widget areas - and several different widget and sidebar locations to make it flexible enough so you can have the content you want in the location you choose.

Theme is built to be SEO friendly, utilizing proper title tags and other markup where appropriate. It also includes some basic support for styling Gravity Forms in line with Bootstrap styles.

== Limitations ==
This theme uses `Bootstrap` and the `WP Bootstrap Navwalker` so navigation is limited to only a top level and a single level of dropdown. Additionally items with dropdowns have the links converted to '#' - this is in line with Bootstrap standards and is due to clickable dropdown toggles not being touch screen friendly.
Single page next/previous article pagination uses `previous_post_link()` and `next_post_link()`. This means we cannot prevent the wrapper markup being added to the page in the case of there being no next or previous post.
