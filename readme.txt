A Bootstrap 4 powered theme with a vibrant color scheme. It has an emphasis on clear typography with enough space for your content to breath.

== Description ==
Best Reloaded is a theme built using Bootstrap 4 as a base. It includes all of the Bootstrap Styles and Scripts enqueued ready to use as you desire. It offers a custom hompeage template, with a slider, and several different widget and sidebar locations to make it flexible enough so you can have the content you want in the location you choose.

It includes some basic support for styling Gravity Forms with Bootstrap styles and is SEO friendly, untilizing proper title tags where appropriate.

== Limitations ==
Naviagion is limited to only a sinlge level of dropdown. Additionally top level items with dropdowns are not links - this is in line with Bootstrap standards and is due to clickable dropdown toggles not being touch screen friendly.
Single page next/previous article pagination uses `previous_post_link()` and `next_post_link()`. This means we cannot prevent the wrapper markup being added to the page in the case of there being no next or previous post.
